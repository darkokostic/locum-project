                    LocumOD was born out of the question, how are practices managing OD time away from the business? Experience of European markets and other medically related professions showed that Locums are used to great effect in providing continuing care and revenue.

                    All that was missing in Canada was an easy to use, effective way of finding Locum professionals and corresponding Practice Vacancies. We set about building this service to bring together flexible Doctors of Optometry and innovative Practices wishing to deliver continual availability to their patients.

                Most practices will see an inevitable dip in revenue and productivity when the Doctors take vacation. Without eye examinations and Dr recommendations to drive patient purchases, retail activity falls to collections, outside Rx and adjustments. Bookings and recalls are pushed to when the Dr returns creating a wave of overbooked days.
