             	<p>This agreement (“Terms of Service” or “Agreement” or “Terms and Conditions”) is a contract between you and locumod Services ltd If you are a user of www.locumOD.com, hereinafter referred to as “the Website” or “the Site”. The Site is offered to you based on the condition that you accept this Agreement.

				<h4>Services offered by LocumOD.com</h4>
				<p>This Website will enable Optical Service Practices to post an advertisement for a vacancy, which requires a locum Doctor of Optometry.

Once the job is accepted, the locum Optometrist is required to complete the job. Once this is done, the pharmacy must pay the Locum Optometrist the fee as agreed on locumOD.com (however, please note that LocumOD.com does not hold any responsibility and hence cannot be held liable for any non-payment of fees by the Employer or non-completion of any job allotted to the locum, as elaborated in the terms to follow) and both parties can leave each other feedback on the Website.
